Subject: ANNOUNCE: Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2015.0825 (2015-08-25) released

Informix Database Driver for Perl DBI Version 2015.0825 (2015-08-25) has been uploaded to CPAN.

IBM Informix Database Driver for Perl (also known as DBD::Informix) is
the driver code that enables Perl 5.8.1 or later to access Informix
databases via the DBI module (but if you are not already using Perl
5.22.0 - or a later version - you should be planning to upgrade Perl).
You will to install DBI version 1.607 or later as well (v1.634 - or any
later version - is recommended) before installing DBD::Informix.  The
code for DBD::Informix is available for download via:

http://www.perl.org/CPAN/modules/by-category/07_Database_Interfaces
http://dbi.perl.org/

** When you successfully build this module, use the ItWorks (Perl)
** script to report your configuration to the maintenance team (meaning
** Jonathan Leffler) at dbd.informix@gmail.com.
** The ItWorks script does not send email to anybody; you have to do
** that yourself.

New in release 2015.0821
* Deal with changes to ExtUtils::MakeMaker that broke the build.
* Update to require Perl 5.8.1 and DBI 1.607.
* Change work email address back to jleffler@us.ibm.com

New in release 2013.0521
* Support CSDK 4.10 for IDS 12.10
* Change work email address to jleffler@google.com

New in release 2013.0206:
* Bug fix release (not generally available).
* Properly handle the new ESQL/C version 4.10.

New in release 2013.0113:
* Bug fix release.
* Workaround for bug in ESQL/C 3.70 and earlier that generates error -1820
  when reopening a cursor that previously fetched LVARCHAR data.
* Fix for INFORMIXDIR containing Perl regex metacharacters.
* Other minor improvements as documented in the ChangeLog.
* Formal support for ESQL/C 7.x and 8.x (don't ask why the
  current version numbers are smaller) will be dropped after this
  release.  The code won't go away yet, but it is beyond time to
  get off those versions.  ESQL/C 5.20 is nominally supported for
  those still using Informix OnLine 5.20, but there is no
  testing on that platform.

Support email address:
* This release is supported by Jonathan Leffler <dbd.informix@gmail.com>.
* You may also report your bugs via the CPAN resolution tracking system:
    http://rt.cpan.org/
* Such bug reports can be sent by email to bug-DBD-Informix@rt.cpan.org;
  they also get sent to dbd.informix@gmail.com, etc.

As always, see the ChangeLog file for details about what has changed.
